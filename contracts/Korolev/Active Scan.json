  "chainDescription": "Veltecite fuels Prospect Station's power generators, foundries, engines, and is its main export. The few mineral deposits exposed to the surface can generally be found near water, but tracking one down can be time consuming, and dangerous.\r\nWouldn't it be nice to have an easier and faster way to get to it? Fortunately Korolev has a few techs working on just the thing."

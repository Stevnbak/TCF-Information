It's an important discovery; the compound has so far only been collected as a volatile, quickly decaying gas, and it's not exactly safe to handle.\r\nWhat little has been collected so far revolutionized Veltecite refining, having a stable source of both would be massive... for Korolev's profits. Definitely worth investigating!"

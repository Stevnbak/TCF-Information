      "lore": "Originally intended to be an ambusher cloak, with the field around the user providing a noticeable speed boost to anything emitted from within it to improve offensive potential, the in that configuration the cloak was found to rapidly irradiate into the surroundings with whatever object was inside it. According to internal documents, no tests on human operators were ever performed, though Korolev was never known for keeping accurate or truthful records.  Fortunately for the company, a simple inversion (and massive powering down) of the field was found to provide operators with a useful boost to their movement speed, though at the cost of increasing that of anything impacting the field. The field manual however has this covered, sternly advising the user with 'Don't get shot'."

      "lore": "Osiris opted to reinvent the wheel on this one, believing existing cloaking technology was simply lacking in its purported goal of actually cloaking the user. Plus it seemed cheaper and easier than paying the lawyers to figure out who still owned the rights to existing cloaking tech and dealing with whatever clods had come up with the original design.  This new cloak was capable of completely hiding its operator from view and conventional optic sensors, though it had the slight drawback of completely immobilizing the user while active (technically, operators could move, though it would cause excruciating pain and the cloak is unable to mute screams). With some fine-tuning the device was made to be slightly less effective while the operator attempted to remain perfectly still, and still allow full movement while active, though even a light gait will cause the cloak to shimmer brightly."

      "lore": "Based on the same technology used to defend starships and stations from munitions and space debris for hundreds of years, the Kinetic Shield can project a small barrier able to take significant punishment before collapsing.  Thanks to some clever tech the AI controller on a prospector's suit is able to tell the barrier which projectiles and energy emissions to let through and which not, allowing the barrier's owner to fire through it while shielding them from oncoming fire."

      "lore": "The Protective Shell can be a real lifesaver, able to give a surprised prospector a chance to react to an ambush or stop an incoming missile from, well, doing what missiles do. And while it makes its user practically invulnerable without affecting their own weapons, the Shell's energy consumption is far too great to stay active for long.  Still, the tech has improved significantly since the first prototypes... between operators trapped in a rolling energy-egg rolling around the testing ground and discovering the need for strict user height limitations, the device is now almost completely safe to use!"

      "name": "Safeguard",
      "description": "A kinetic dome that covers a larger area with a strong shield that blocks both enemy and friendly fire.",
      "lore": "The Safeguard was developed for use in warzones where mission critical buildings and equipment were meant to be kept protected at all times from enemy fire, without impeding their actual use. While it can cover a larger area and take on more damage than the standard barrier, it doesn't discriminate friend or foe, allowing both to pass through the barrier freely, while also blocking all weapons' fire.  Some prospectors tinkered with prototypes that blocked movement entirely, the concept was quickly dropped; while this was found to be a useful way of keeping bad things out, it also had the unforeseen side effect of trapping its user inside, possibly with something they don't want to be near; a popular video typically shown to bright-eyed station arrivals shows the effects of a prospector missing the timing when attempting to block an incoming Warden Alpha. Good way to sober them up, and to remind people to not mod their abilities."

The unstable part is key here. Turns out with some small tweaks you can syphon the energy mean to stabilize the warp transfer into a small energy blast just as the transfer initiates. Unfortunately the warp projectile's speed had to be reduced to compensate, though this was only discovered after testing.  Junior Researcher Ricardo Galvin is still on sabbatical and Korolev has no time for spurious speculation on his whereabouts."

    "Faction_FactionScreen_Korolev_DetailedDescription": {
      "name": "Korolev Heavy Industries is the result of hundreds of corporations coalescing into a single massive entity over the course of two centuries, forming a practical monopoly in several markets. The megacorp operates practically everywhere humanity's managed to reach, building large scale and cheap structures along with the machines needed to build them, the myriad of tools required for life outside in frontier systems, and the ships to take them there. With heavy ties to powerful political factions on almost every major world and a market dominance only challenged by their rival CoTEC, Korolev has found itself with more money and power than it knows what to do with.  The corp's presence on Fortuna III was nothing noteworthy before the Cycle hit; the planet had cast quantities of Veltecite, as do all other Progenitor seeded planets, so they had an interest in mining claims and not just simple production. Once the Cycle hit and the the prospects of reaping the planet's resources dwindled, most Korolev personnel and its assets left for greener pastures, leaving behind a skeleton crew to ensure their claims would remain in place once (or if) the Cycle ever abated. The corp's activities on Fortuna III are overseen by Vadim Tanayev, a man with nepotism to thank for his rise in the corporate ranks, and cut-through politics for his ostracism to Fortuna III after an industrial accident at a plant he oversaw tarnished his career.  Unfortunately for Korolev, the Authority charter governing Fortuna III forbids non-scientific corporate activity on the planet. Licensed prospectors, however, are allowed on the surface at their own risk, and Korolev is keen on hiring to provide a small but steady supply of Veltecite and other resources flowing to help validate the legitimacy of their presence on Prospect Station, and ultimately, Fortuna III.  Korolev gear follows the mantra of 'it just works'. No bells and whistles, no safety features, no nonsense. Korolev items do what it says on the tin, which in most cases involve explosives. Their kit might not be geared towards mobility, opting instead for high durability and higher impact."

    "Faction_FactionScreen_Osiris_DetailedDescription": {
      "name": "A relatively young corporation, Osiris' parent company Blue Star Ltd. had a long history of buying incipient and struggling R&D and tech firms to develop and license patents to third parties. Blue Star founded Osiris from the ashes of several R&D firms, with experience in fields ranging from arms research, robotics, genetic engineering, and most notably the (now defunct) founders of the warp gates that connect the prosperous Artery systems together. As a financially and legally independent company, Osiris has been tasked to lead their research on frontier planets, with their advantage of carry less legal oversight than Artery systems, of what anything that could be the next major technological breakthrough in human history. Or just be another in a series of failed investments on the edge of space that almost invariably result in massive loss of life, one of the two.  It's current head is Emmanuel Sullivan, a visionary researcher only recently recruited by Blue Star to lead the operations on Fortuna III; between the Teratomorphic Energy Field, the unique and rapidly mutating fauna and flora, and the never-ending supply of Veltecite, the planet promises a wealth of scientific discoveries beyond imagination.  While Osiris had license to operate on the surface for research purposes, they recently started hiring Prospectors to handle the bulk of their planetary matter after several unfortunate, and costly, incidents; from now on Osiris' (remaining) field research personnel are confined to the station.  Osiris' ideals for precision and expertise are mirrored in the gear favored prospectors can acquire from them. Almost always using the latest prototype tech, the corp's gear can sometimes seem esoteric, too niche, or just too finicky, but it's brutally in the rights hands."

    "Faction_FactionScreen_ICA_DetailedDescription": {
      "name": "The Independent Civilian Advisory is a political organization present on many permanent stations and settlements across Federal space. It exists with official recognition and support by the Federal Authority to help set up civilian institutions and associations independent from any major corporations or nations. Officially, it's a non-profit organization that answers to the Federation, and to the nation it operates under if one is present, to ensure basic needs and freedoms for the population it manages without interference by corporations. Often, it's the real government and only civilian focused organization in areas where there is no official, or effective, government.  The ICA on Prospect Station organizes several companies and businesses needed to keep the station community healthy and acts as an interface between Habitat, the official station owners, and the various factions of the station, including Prospectors and interstellar corporations. The Advisory is headed by a committee made up of former colonists, station oligarchs, business representatives, and union leaders, each with their own conflicting interests, often leading to the organization having no clear goals other than the wellbeing of the station's populace and maintaining the status quo that allows for the organization to profit off its dealings with prospectors.  While the ICA competes with other major players for the resources of Fortuna III, the organization is protected and respected on the station, where it carries out its duties without too much interference. Plus, every major company has card carrying ICA members in its workforce, something that makes overt moves against them difficult to carry out, never mind unpopular among the station's populace.  ICA gear is a mix standard kit built on station with the environment's scarce and unique resources, and custom items that borrow inspiration from those of other factions or the planet itself. Over all, ICA favors balanced and versatile, with few exceptions."

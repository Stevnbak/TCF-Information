Someone figured out a way to the trigger a reaction in the nanobots' own batteries and get a small burst of energy from them; not much, but with billions of bots in a liter of NiC, it could be the answer to our energy troubles. Now, we just need to build some pumps! Get us these materials so we can fix up a first batch.\"",

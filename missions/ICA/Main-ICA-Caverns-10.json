High concentration of iron, some chromium and nickel, and some elements the machine refuses to identify; otherwise this just seems like a substandard steel alloy with weird patterns. So, is it just because it's rare? Because it's 'alien'? People died, for this? And now Korolev and Osiris are investing in the area, again! You need to go down there, make a mess, make them rethink how 'safe' those damned caverns are!\"",

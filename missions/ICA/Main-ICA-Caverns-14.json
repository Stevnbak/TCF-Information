If what the Osiris' people believed is true, that this is some sort of programmable smart metal centuries ahead of our own tech, then we can't let the wrong people get their hands on it! I have the location of another scientist; retrieve whatever data they had, and leave purging any existing research data on the matter to us. Thank you, Prospector.\"",

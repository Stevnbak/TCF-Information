  "description": "\"All killed. Not surprising, of course, but definitely not all were killed by surface beasts. The obvious suspects would be Korolev's goons; our people may have found something important those meatheads wanted for themselves, or maybe it was something more basic, like commandeering the site's vessels to evac. I need to think... this happened decades ago, but it would still be an unacceptable transgression. For now, just go back to those caverns and do some field work; apparently the caverns had some unique flora.\"",

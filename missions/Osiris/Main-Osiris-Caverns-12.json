It makes sense that they would place self-sufficient outposts on the planets they terraformed. You must remain my proxy on this venture, the island is still far too dangerous for a team to investigate directly; head back to the Forge, feed it Tharis Iron, and bring back the results.\r\nAnd get rid of any onlookers.\"",

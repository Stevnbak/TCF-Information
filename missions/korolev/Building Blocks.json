Fortunately Korolev used to operate Mobile Mining Platforms, giant laser drills that would float through the peaceful skies of Fortuna III in search of mineral veins to exploit.\r\nThe days those things could be safely operated are long gone, but they're just the thing we need now to mine for Letium, with some assistance on the ground."

With some fine-tuning the device was made to be slightly less effective while the operator attempted to remain perfectly still, and still allow full movement while active, though even a light gait will cause the cloak to shimmer brightly."

While it can cover a larger area and take on more damage than the standard barrier, it doesn't discriminate friend or foe, allowing both to pass through the barrier freely, while also blocking all weapons' fire.\r\n\r\nSome prospectors tinkered with prototypes that blocked movement entirely, the concept was quickly dropped; while this was found to be a useful way of keeping bad things out, it also had the unforeseen side effect of trapping its user inside, possibly with something they don't want to be near; a popular video typically shown to bright-eyed station arrivals shows the effects of a prospector missing the timing when attempting to block an incoming Warden Alpha.

Not much is known about the island or why the corps set up shop there, but Marie hopes you'll find clues as to what happened to the colonists at the Korolev and Osiris installations.   And while you're there, maybe you could look into why the corps were so interested in the island's caverns in the first place...","chainImage":"T_UI_Mission_Main-ICA-Questlines_Caverns_p","chainPart":2,"key":"Main-ICA-Caverns-0.2-Unlock"},{"inGameName":"The Progenitor Device Part 1","description":"We have received some intel on one of our old research sites potentially being ready to be reclaimed.

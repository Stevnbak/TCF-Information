According to internal documents, no tests on human operators were ever performed, though Korolev was never known for keeping accurate or truthful records.  Fortunately for the company, a simple inversion (and massive powering down) of the field was found to provide operators with a useful boost to their movement speed, though at the cost of increasing that of anything impacting the field.

While it can cover a larger area and take on more damage than the standard barrier, it doesn't discriminate friend or foe, allowing both to pass through the barrier freely, while also blocking all weapons' fire.  Some prospectors tinkered with prototypes that blocked movement entirely, the concept was quickly dropped; while this was found to be a useful way of keeping bad things out, it also had the unforeseen side effect of trapping its user inside, possibly with something they don't want to be near; a popular video typically shown to bright-eyed station arrivals shows the effects of a prospector missing the timing when attempting to block an incoming Warden Alpha.

<BH2>'The Cycle'</>, is a hazardous radiation effect that encompasses the entire planet of Fortuna III, though there exist 'windows' that allow for humans, and their technology, to operate without suffering the worst effects.  Initially only causing delicate equipment to malfunction, each wave, found to be following a predictable cadence, increased in intensity until basic machinery failed entirely and colonists left unconscious for the duration. Less than a month after <BH2>the colonies were evacuated</> the energy field settled over the entire world, with its ebb and flow causing <BH2>terrible storms</> over the areas not fully covered by The Cycle."},"Codex_Fortuna_Map2":{"description":"Located next to <BH2>Bright Sands</>, the large fallen Progenitor ruin at its center gave the area its name. Originally meant to support the construction and eventual operation of the nearby Archimedes science campus, the warm natural pools and rich fertile soil attracted enough interest and business to form the beginnings of a small community of its own.  Even experienced prospectors should be cautious here, as some of the fiercest creatures have make their nests in the abandoned shipping ports and overgrown facilities."},"Codex_Station":{"description":"Orbiting Fortuna III, Habitat's station was never meant to house even a tenth of its current population, numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Built to be a holding area for the rich and powerful, and the system-wide HQ for several megacorps, the station became home to most of the colonists fleeing the surface, with entire freighters and other ships grafted on to it to make space for the new population.

Currently its goal is just to keep the station alive and its community healthy, acting as an interface between Habitat, the official station owners, and the various <BH2>factions</> of the station, including the Prospectors that help retrieve vital resources.  The Advisory committee is made up of former colonists, station oligarchs, business representatives, and union leaders, each with their own conflicting interests, often leading to the organization having no clear goals other than the general wellbeing of the station's populace and maintaining a somewhat peaceful status quo."},"Codex_Factions_Osiris":{"description":"Formed from the remnants of several research shops and filled with academics, <BH2>Osiris</> was left rudderless after the Cycle cut off effective communications with their parent company. While their goal of researching Progenitor artefacts and reverse engineering their technology remains the same, without access to the surface itself their work was limited to just idle theorizing.

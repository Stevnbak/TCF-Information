According to internal documents, no tests on human operators were ever performed, though Korolev was never known for keeping accurate or truthful records.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the company, a simple inversion (and massive powering down) of the field was found to provide operators with a useful boost to their movement speed, though at the cost of increasing that of anything impacting the field. The field manual however has this covered, sternly advising the user with Don't get shot."},"Abilities_Cloak_Still":{"description":"A cloaking device that significantly improves effectiveness when static, at the cost of lower effectiveness when moving.","name":"Concealment Cloak","lore":"Osiris opted to reinvent the wheel on this one, believing existing cloaking technology was simply lacking in its purported goal of actually cloaking the user. Plus it seemed cheaper and easier than paying the lawyers to figure out who still owned the rights to existing cloaking tech and dealing with whatever clods had come up with the original design.\r\n\r\nThis new cloak was capable of completely hiding its operator from view and conventional optic sensors, though it had the slight drawback of completely immobilizing the user while active (technically, operators could move, though it would cause excruciating pain and the cloak is unable to mute screams). With some fine-tuning the device was made to be slightly less effective while the operator attempted to remain perfectly still, and still allow full movement while active, though even a light gait will cause the cloak to shimmer brightly."},"Abilities_SurveillanceWard":{"description":"A deployable scanner that reveals prospectors and objectives on the map.","lore":"A disposable, orbital-dropped scanner, Osiris uses these to find the best mineral deposits on the surface, but isn't adverse to launching them for Prospectors with high enough standing.\r\n\r\nIf you hear a sort of beeping sound coming from the scanner, that's actually its scan pulses reverberating inside your skull and impacting some dense matter.

The megacorp operates practically everywhere humanity's managed to reach, building large scale and cheap structures along with the machines needed to build them, the myriad of tools required for life outside in frontier systems, and the ships to take them there. With heavy ties to powerful political factions on almost every major world and a market dominance only challenged by their rival CoTEC, Korolev has found itself with more money and power than it knows what to do with.\r\n\r\nThe corp's presence on Fortuna III was nothing noteworthy before the Cycle hit; the planet had cast quantities of Veltecite, as do all other Progenitor seeded planets, so they had an interest in mining claims and not just simple production. Once the Cycle hit and the the prospects of reaping the planet's resources dwindled, most Korolev personnel and its assets left for greener pastures, leaving behind a skeleton crew to ensure their claims would remain in place once (or if) the Cycle ever abated. The corp's activities on Fortuna III are overseen by Vadim Tanayev, a man with nepotism to thank for his rise in the corporate ranks, and cut-through politics for his ostracism to Fortuna III after an industrial accident at a plant he oversaw tarnished his career.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Korolev, the Authority charter governing Fortuna III forbids non-scientific corporate activity on the planet. Licensed prospectors, however, are allowed on the surface at their own risk, and Korolev is keen on hiring to provide a small but steady supply of Veltecite and other resources flowing to help validate the legitimacy of their presence on Prospect Station, and ultimately, Fortuna III.\r\n\r\nKorolev gear follows the mantra of it just works.

According to internal documents, no tests on human operators were ever performed, though Korolev was never known for keeping accurate or truthful records.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the company, a simple inversion (and massive powering down) of the field was found to provide operators with a useful boost to their movement speed, though at the cost of increasing that of anything impacting the field. The field manual however has this covered, sternly advising the user with \"Don't get shot\"."},"Abilities_Cloak_Still":{"description":"A cloaking device that significantly improves effectiveness when static, at the cost of lower effectiveness when moving.","name":"Concealment Cloak","lore":"Osiris opted to reinvent the wheel on this one, believing existing cloaking technology was simply lacking in its purported goal of actually cloaking the user. Plus it seemed cheaper and easier than paying the lawyers to figure out who still owned the rights to existing cloaking tech and dealing with whatever clods had come up with the original design.\r\n\r\nThis new cloak was capable of completely hiding its operator from view and conventional optic sensors, though it had the slight drawback of completely immobilizing the user while active (technically, operators could move, though it would cause excruciating pain and the cloak is unable to mute screams). With some fine-tuning the device was made to be slightly less effective while the operator attempted to remain perfectly still, and still allow full movement while active, though even a light gait will cause the cloak to shimmer brightly."},"Abilities_SurveillanceWard":{"description":"A deployable scanner that reveals prospectors and objectives on the map.","lore":"A disposable, orbital-dropped scanner, Osiris uses these to find the best mineral deposits on the surface, but isn't adverse to launching them for Prospectors with high enough standing.\r\n\r\nIf you hear a sort of beeping sound coming from the scanner, that's actually its scan pulses reverberating inside your skull and impacting some dense matter.

The Teratomorphic Energy Field changed all that, with monstruous creatures emerging from the unknown to savage the panicked colonists as they fled the planet's surface. \r\n\r\nOnce prospectors began braving the first windows in the Cycle a decade later, they found Fortuna III overrun with large and <BH2>highly hostile beasts</> of unnatural design. Some believe these creatures were always there, hiding under the surface; others see them as the result of constant mutations spurred by the TEF. In either case it's clear that the Cycle is to blame for their appearance, and <BH2>the Storms</> that affect the planet make these creatures even more dangerous."},"Codex_VanityShop":{"description":"Cosmetic items help you stand apart from the competition and define how you want to look on Fortuna III, but don't have any gameplay effects.\r\n\r\nThere are various types, and <BH2>any Cosmetics you unlock or purchase are tied to your account and won't be lost on the surface or during Season Wipes.</>"},"Codex_Factions_MissionsJobs":{"description":"Each faction, will offer you a series of <BH2>Missions</> that further their goals on Fortuna III; completing these won't just reward you with K-Marks and a reputation boost, but often useful kit, and more.\r\n\r\n<BH2>Jobs</> are often more simpler tasks, the bread and butter for prospectors, getting each faction what it needs to keep itself in operation. Access to these is gated by your reputation with the faction, with the higher tier Jobs also increasing in difficulty... and rewards."},"Codex_FortunaPass":{"description":"Each season a new <BH2>Fortuna Pass</> will become available, offering the chance to unlock free rewards for completing a number of gameplay actions, from killing hostile creatures, evaccing off the surface, or completing <BH2>Jobs</> for the <BH2>Factions</>.\r\n\r\nYou'll also be able to purchase access to Premium rewards, offering unique seasonal cosmetic items, by purchasing the <BH2>Premium Pass</> with <BH2>Aurum</>.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're in a rush, you can put in some <BH2>Aurum</> to skip a level and immediately unlock a reward!"},"Codex_Prospecting_Tools":{"description":"Every prospector needs some basic tools to get the job done.\r\n\r\nYour <BH2>Scanner</> will highlight valuable minerals in the area.

You've got a standard <BH2>Flashlight</> for when it's dark, and a pair of basic <BH2>Binoculars</> to survey an area from afar."},"Codex_Fortuna":{"description":"First settled in 2309, Fortuna III was on course to be one of the most prosperous worlds under humanity's domain, before what's known as <BH2>'The Cycle'</> upended everything half a century later, destroying the Progenitor-built Waygate orbiting the moon and cutting the Fortuna system from the rest of humanity.\r\n\r\nAs a Habitable 'Class 5' planet, Fortuna III had been terraformed tens of thousands of years by a lost civilization referred to as the Progenitors, with an ecosystem practically identical to that of other H-C5 planets, and a similar abundance of the energy-rich <BH2>Veltecite</> that fuels the Waygates connecting them. Why the Progenitors seeded these planets and then vanished isn't yet known, as the only tangible evidence of their existence are the Waygates and inert monuments that dot each planet's surface.\r\n\r\nThe planet's surface now lies practically abandoned, with only <BH2>Prospectors</> and other fools braving <BH2>The Cycle</>, and the planet's hostile fauna, to secure resources for the station in orbit."},"Codex_Factions_Osiris":{"description":"Formed from the remnants of several research shops and filled with academics, <BH2>Osiris</> was left rudderless after the Cycle cut off effective communications with their parent company. While their goal of researching Progenitor artefacts and reverse engineering their technology remains the same, without access to the surface itself their work was limited to just idle theorizing.\r\n\r\nThankfully the corporation's newest head recognized the value prospectors could offer and is more than happy to send them off to danger for a pittance, so long as they remain effective."},"Codex_Prospecting_Armor":{"description":"If you want to keep your insides inside, then you'll want to equip a <BH2>Shield</> vest and a <BH2>Helmet</>. The higher the <BH2>Armor</> value, the more damage it will absorb from each hit, while a higher <BH2>Durability</> keeps it, and you, intact for longer.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to <BH2>Repair</> your damaged equipment at the <BH2>Gear Printer</>!"},"Codex_Quarters_Upgrades":{"description":"If you've got the right materials in your <BH2>Stash</>, you'll be able to <BH2>upgrade</> your Quarters to help you out in your journey to become the station's best, or richest, prospector. Increase you Stash size, passively earn Aurum and K-Marks, even improve your safe pockets' carrying space; it's worth it."},"Codex_Factions_ICA":{"description":"Initially meant to be only a temporary planetary civilian body to direct the colonization efforts, the <BH2>ICA</> on <BH2>Prospect Station</> came to be the de facto government for the Fortuna system after the Cycle forced the planet's evacuation. Currently its goal is just to keep the station alive and its community healthy, acting as an interface between Habitat, the official station owners, and the various <BH2>factions</> of the station, including the Prospectors that help retrieve vital resources.\r\n\r\nThe Advisory committee is made up of former colonists, station oligarchs, business representatives, and union leaders, each with their own conflicting interests, often leading to the organization having no clear goals other than the general wellbeing of the station's populace and maintaining a somewhat peaceful status quo."},"Codex_Fortuna_Map3":{"description":"Little is known about this island, only recently available to explore after a new window in the Cycle opened up."},"Codex_Fortuna_Map2":{"description":"Located next to <BH2>Bright Sands</>, the large fallen Progenitor ruin at its center gave the area its name. Originally meant to support the construction and eventual operation of the nearby Archimedes science campus, the warm natural pools and rich fertile soil attracted enough interest and business to form the beginnings of a small community of its own.\r\n\r\nEven experienced prospectors should be cautious here, as some of the fiercest creatures have make their nests in the abandoned shipping ports and overgrown facilities."},"Codex_VanityShop_Character&Melee":{"description":"Most <BH2>Prospectors</> can swap around different sets of <BH2>Boots</>, <BH2>Gloves</>, and a <BH2>Chest piece</> assuming you own the kit. Some also come with unique <BH2>Full Suits</>, a type of suit that doesn't allow further customization, but is unique to that <BH2>Prospector</>.\r\n\r\n<BH2>Melee weapons</> can also be swapped around for each Prospector to give them a unique feel. Just note that these don't behave differently than the standard knife!"},"Codex_Fortuna_Map1":{"description":"Once known for its beautiful beaches, thirty years of the Cycle have made Bright Sands more resemble a marsh-filled jungle than what the old postcards depict. The area was to be the location for the Archimedes science campus, an Osiris installation focused on researching Progenitor artifacts in the region; the project was never completed, and the area now lies littered with old infrastructure and temporary support facilities.\r\n\r\nAs the first window in the Cycle to be discovered almost two decades ago, it's well mapped out and considered one of the best starting points for new prospectors to explore."},"Codex_Factions_Korolev":{"description":"One of the oldest interstellar corporations, and once at the forefront of space exploration, Korolev jumped at the opportunity to set up shop a new <BH2>Veltecite-rich</> colony lost in the fringes of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nNow that the Cycle has dashed any hopes profiting off the planet, the remaining <BH2>Korolev</> detachment supports Prospect Station with its industrial prowess, and hopes to lay claim to every bit of ore on the planet once the surface becomes safe to exploit. Assuming that ever happens, at least."},"Codex_Station":{"description":"Orbiting Fortuna III, Habitat's station was never meant to house even a tenth of its current population, numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Built to be a holding area for the rich and powerful, and the system-wide HQ for several megacorps, the station became home to most of the colonists fleeing the surface, with entire freighters and other ships grafted on to it to make space for the new population.\r\n\r\nRenamed to <BH2>\"Prospect Station\"</> once prospectors started dropping to the planet to bring back valuable resources, the station now serves as the hub for a system now cut off from the rest of humanity by a measure of years."},"Codex_Station_QuickShop":{"description":"Run by a former ICA boss, the <BH2>Quick Shop</> provides prospectors with <BH2>basic gear</> to keep them going. Cheap CoTEC guns, ammo, basic bags... nothing fancy, but it all works."},"Codex_Quarters_Deliveries":{"description":"The Delivery Station doesn't just house your <BH2>Generators</>, of course. Had an 'accident' on the surface? Well if you took out <BH2>Insurance</>, here's where you'll find your payout. Have a special delivery from a Bundle purchased a previous season? It'll be waiting for you here. Look around, and don't forget to empty your Generators before they get too full!"},"Codex_Quarters_Generators":{"description":"The Generators will earn you a steady stream of <BH2>K-Marks</> and <BH2>Aurum</>, as well as a crate of useful stuff delivered straight to your quarters every day. Just remember to <BH2>check them regularly</> and invest in <BH2>upgrades</> to improve them!"},"Codex_Station_LaunchingTutorial":{"description":"The Launch Terminal overlooking Fortuna III will get you in your pod and off to whichever death trap you chose to drop to. Just don't forget to tidy your bag and check your gear before you head out!\r\n\r\nYou'll also be able to go through the <BH2>Tutorial Simulation</> again if you need a refresher, or just want to enjoy Fortuna III from the safety of orbit."},"Codex_Fortuna_Cycle":{"description":"The Teratomorphic Energy Field, more commonly known as <BH2>\"The Cycle\"</>, is a hazardous radiation effect that encompasses the entire planet of Fortuna III, though there exist 'windows' that allow for humans, and their technology, to operate without suffering the worst effects.\r\n\r\nInitially only causing delicate equipment to malfunction, each wave, found to be following a predictable cadence, increased in intensity until basic machinery failed entirely and colonists left unconscious for the duration. Less than a month after <BH2>the colonies were evacuated</> the energy field settled over the entire world, with its ebb and flow causing <BH2>terrible storms</> over the areas not fully covered by The Cycle."},"Codex_Prospecting_Insurance":{"description":"The surface is a dangerous place to be, and many prospectors don't make it back on their own two feet. Your suit's stasis foam will protect you and your safe pockets, but your gear, bag, and anything in it won't be coming back to the station with you.\r\n\r\nThat's where insuring your items can help. <BH2>Standard Insurance</> won't get you your items back, but buying it will insure you get some <BH2>K-Marks</> to offset the pain.\r\n\r\n<BH2>Gear Salvage</> will cost you <BH2>Aurum</>, or an <BH2>Insurance Token</>, but a bot wil be sent down to hunt for your missing gear. So long as nobody's looted it and evacced off the planet, you'll get it back in some time. And if someone did, you'll still get a <BH2>K-Mark</> compensation payout.\r\n\r\nRemember to check your <BH2>Delivery Station</> in your <BH2>Quarters</> for payout; there's a limit to how many can be held for you."},"Codex_Station_CraftingRepairing":{"description":"Want <BH2>better gear</>? Then check out the printing station! If you've got the right materials and enough K-Marks, the Gear Printer can handle the hard parts.\r\n\r\nThe Gear Printer is also where you'll want to go to <BH2>repair</> any damaged gear; better to reuse what you've got than buy new each time, right?"},"Codex_Factions":{"description":"While at its peak Fortuna III was home to dozens of massive corporations, only two remain with an active interest in the surface itself, <BH2>Korolev</> and <BH2>Osiris</>. The <BH2>ICA</>, for its part, is the civilian organization that's tasked itself with keeping Prospect Station safely in orbit and all its people alive.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get anywhere as a prospector, you'll have to <BH2>work for them</>; it's not just money they'll reward you with, but access to better and better gear, and that really makes the difference on the surface."},"Codex_Prospecting_Bags":{"description":"While your <BH2>Safety Pockets</> may be able to carry a bit of loot around, a prospector is nothing without their trusty Bag.\r\n\r\nThe better the bag, the more weight it can carry. Be careful to not just fill it up without thinking, though, it'll get heavy, and you never know when you might need to rummage around there in an emergency."},"Codex_VanityShop_Other":{"description":"You can further personalize your <BH2>Prospector</> with <BH2>Sprays</> and <BH2>Banners</> to decorate Fortuna III, and <BH2>Emotes</> to show off to others what you're really thinking."},"Codex_Quarters":{"description":"You own quarters.
